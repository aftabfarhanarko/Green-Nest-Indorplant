🪴 GreenNest – Indoor Plant Care & Store

GreenNest is a responsive and elegant single-page React application built for indoor plant lovers. This project showcases how modern front-end technologies can create a calm and nature-inspired shopping and care experience. The platform allows users to browse beautiful indoor plants, learn about their care, and book consultations with green experts — all in one place.

The application is developed entirely from scratch using React, React Router DOM, and Tailwind CSS for smooth navigation and responsive design. Plant data is fetched from a custom plants.json file, displaying product details such as name, category, price, rating, and care level.

Authentication is handled securely with Firebase, implementing Email/Password Signup, Login, Google Sign-In, and Forgot Password features. Protected routes ensure that only logged-in users can access the Plant Details and My Profile pages. The profile page allows real-time updates of user information using Firebase’s updateProfile() method.

For better user experience, the app includes global and route-based loading states using useNavigation() and a custom <Loder /> component. The MainLayout keeps the Navbar and Footer persistent across all routes, ensuring a consistent SPA experience without reloads or crashes.

Additional sections such as Plant Care Tips, Meet Our Green Experts, and Eco Decor Ideas enhance the overall engagement and educational value. Every part of the project — from design to routing, Firebase setup, and animations — has been implemented manually to demonstrate complete development skills.
